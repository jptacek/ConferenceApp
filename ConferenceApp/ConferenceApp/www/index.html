                <h1>Clark Sell, Microsoft</h1>
                <p>Clark is a web evangelist for Microsoft based in Illinois. A Chicago native who can’t spell, Clark as a kid actually made his money building cars, getting grease under his nails. That art of building would later lead him to software development where he drinks the Web Development Kool-Aid. Writing code is what keeps Clark awake at night, while continually working on his craft and rapping with others over a few cold CORS. You can hear Clark muse about software on his podcast Developer Smackdown, or find his family cruising around in a 1968 Camaro SS.</p>

                <h1>Using Phonegap to Develop Native Mobile Application for Multiple Platforms</h1>
                Mobile applications are becoming more and more important to business and organizations. However, developing mobile applications is becoming more and more costly because the popularity of different mobile platforms means rewriting the application for each. Phonegap is a toolset that enables creating a single application that can be deployed as a native application to numerous mobile platforms like iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7. Come see how you can use Visual Studio and your HTML and Javascript skills to develop iOS, Android and WP7 apps!<br/>

                <h1>Managing the .NET Compiler</h1>
                <p>With the public release of Project Roslyn, Microsoft has finally let .NET developers get access to their long-awaited compiler APIs. The potential impact of having a compiler API available for all developers is immense. In this session, you'll get a tour of the elements behind this new API, such as syntax trees and engines, and how you can use them in code analysis and metaprogramming techniques.</p>
